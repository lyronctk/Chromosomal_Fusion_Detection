# Chromosomal Fusion Detection

Written during a sophomore year summer internship for Stanford University. Detects **chromosomal fusions** in a patient by analyzing sequencing data from tumors. Utilizes **data structures & techniques** in C++ to optimize runtime, common **bioinformatics** libraries and file formats, and *bash* to run the pipeline.  

* Improvements can be made in modularity and general coding style.
